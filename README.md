A zoomable map of Perth, with a time-slider ranging from the first census in
1911 to the current day. Watch the growth of Perth over the past 100 years,
or focus on your suburb and see how many people lived there in your
grandmother's day.

*Evolution of Perth* is built on the Google Maps API, with local government
boundaries and historical demographics from the Australian Bureau of
Statistics. Within the time limit imposed by the GovHack event, we were
only able to present population density at the level of local government
area. But in the future there is potential to "mine" the archives of the
State Records Office and the State Library, and bring to life population
and land use data at the community or even street level.
